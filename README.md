# Hiring Process: Process Model Improvement

## Purpose of the Project 
The purpose of this project was to document an efficient hiring process at a company. A well defined approach would be cost effective and will streamline how the company finds and qualifies candidates. Hiring individuals is a collaborative process so it requires effective communication between all parties involved as well as necessary planning ahead for all possible case scenarios. 

## Background
The typical hiring process starts when a position requisition opens and ends when a person signs a new employment contract. This process was followed, including the narrowing of potential hires down to the final round of the top three candidates, then finally to the single employee signing on. The entities that were focused on were position requisites, applicants, hiring managers, and human resources. The proposed changes to this process revolved around incorporating a multi-round hiring process, whereby the candidates will be eliminated in multiple rounds, with the final round ending with three top candidates that are not eliminated directly prior to the signing on of a single hire.
